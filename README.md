# ~~Secret Santa~~  Invisible friend

Yet another chapter of the series "Things that should be easy to find in the internet but aren't".
This time i'm creating an invisible friend implementation, i thought of this as an opportunity to learn some useful stuff, like Flask, server-side rendering, github pipelines and github projects.

The idea is super simple:
* Create a group
* Generate a link so everybody can join the group **without registering** and saving its name and email **or** give the option to create a group manually
* When everybody is ready, trigger the email sending to everybody, with just the name of its invisible friend.
